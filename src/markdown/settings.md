# How to configure the Calendly Plugin

There is no configuration required at Plugin level.

All you need to do is click on the `Add Calendly components` button on the left:

This will add the Calendly embed element in the `Add` menu of your project:

You can then drag-and-drop this element wherever you want in your project.
