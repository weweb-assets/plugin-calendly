# How to configure the Calendly Plugin

There is no configuration required at Plugin level.

All you need to do is click on the "Add Calendly components" button on the left. 

This will add the Calendly Embed element in the "Add" Menu of your project:

You can then drag-and-drop this element wherever you want in your project.

Assuming you already have a Calendly account, you can then paste the link to your Calendly Calendar or a specific Calendly Meeting in the Calendly Embed element's Specific Settings:
